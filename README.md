# Project-8-Crazy-Taxi
This project aims to analyze mobility patterns in Chicago to optimize Zuber's ride-sharing services. We will use ride data to identify trends and better understand user needs, particularly in relation to weather conditions.

Objective:

To understand the factors influencing ride-sharing choices and demand in Chicago, and to provide insights for optimizing Zuber's services.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Utilized a robust dataset containing information on rides from various transportation companies in Chicago.
Data Analysis: Employed statistical techniques to analyze ride patterns, identify trends, and assess the impact of external factors.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted t-tests to determine the significance of weather conditions on trip duration.
Key Findings:

No significant impact of weather on trip duration: Statistical analysis did not find a strong correlation between weather conditions and the average duration of trips.
Limitations: The study was limited by the sample size and the need for further analysis of specific weather types.
Recommendations:

Increase sample size or conduct more granular analysis: To draw more definitive conclusions, consider increasing the sample size or analyzing specific weather conditions in more detail.
Explore other factors: Investigate additional factors that may influence ride-sharing choices, such as pricing, availability, and user preferences.
Conclusion:

This study provides valuable insights into the mobility patterns of Chicago residents and offers recommendations for optimizing Zuber's services. While weather conditions did not have a significant impact on trip duration in this analysis, further research could explore other factors and potentially uncover additional insights.
